# Gravity Game

This project is a simple and clean website that runs a game inspired by the quizlet gravity game that was deleted. The purpose of the gravity game is to memorize information.

To play the game, you should:
- Create cards by entering prompts and answers in the "card data" text field at the bottom left. Delimiters should be used to separate prompts from answers and cards from one another.
- Change the card spawning delay (delay between 2 card spawns) and the difficulty (speed at which the cards fall down).
- Begin the game by pressing the "Start Game" button.
- Write the answers to the visible cards in the text field in the middle of the page, and press enter to remove the answered cards before they hit the bottom of the game area.

If the top of a card hits the bottom of the game area (leaving the game area entirely) the game is lost. It can also be stopped by holding the square located between the score and level counters for a moment.
